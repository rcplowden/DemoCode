# Code Examples

This repo contains sample code from Java projects completed while at University.

## Blackjack

Group project completed for an algorithm analysis course taught by Gene Tagliarini completed with Joseph Libby.  Contains object oriented abstraction of a simple game of blackjack and a combinatorial analysis approach, using depth first search to attempt to play blackjack profitably.  This project uses a pregenerated shoe of 250,000 decks in which 4 hands are played from each deck.

## Matrix Arithmetic Java Library

Toolkit of matrix operations used for digital signal processing, implemented for a scientific computing course.  Also contains other coursework - including exhaustive, genetic, and simulated annealing approaches to solving TSP.

### Includes
- Gauss Reduction 
- Cooley Tukey FFT
- Essential Matrix Operators
