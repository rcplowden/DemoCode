# Code Examples

This repo contains sample code from Java projects completed while at University.

## Blackjack

Group project completed for an algorithm analysis course taught by Gene Tagliarini completed with Joseph Libby.  Contains object oriented abstraction of a simple game of blackjack and three algorithms that attempt to play blackjack profitably.  These algorithms include a combinatorial analysis that utilizes depth first search, a naive approach, and a modified monte carlo.

## Matrix Arithmetic Java Library

Toolkit of matrix operations used for digital signal processing, implemented for a scientific computing course.  This library includes Gauss Reduction, Cooley Tukey FFT, and essential matrix operators.
